/*//Approach-3 (using bitwise left-shift & right-shift)
Another approach is by using bitwise left-shift and right-shift operators. The logic behind this implementation is about regenerating the value after the right shift and left shift. We all know even numbers have zero as the last bit and odd have one as the last bit. When we bitwise right shift any number then the last bit of the number piped out whenever it is even or odd. Next, we did a bitwise left shift, then our bit shifted by one. Now last bit placed is empty which is by default filled by a zero. During all these odd numbers changed their value but even remains the same. Thatâ€™s how by comparing the initial and final value we decide number is even or odd.
